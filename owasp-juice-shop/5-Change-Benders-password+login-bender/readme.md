## Solution Steps

### Step 1: Login with SQL Injection

### Step 3: Modify Request in Burp Suite

- Open Burp Suite and intercept the request when you submit the password reset form.
- Modify the parameters in the request:
  - Delete the "current password" parameter.
  - Keep the "new password" and "repeat new password" fields.
- Send the modified request through Burp Suiteâ€™s Repeater feature to bypass the current password requirement.
