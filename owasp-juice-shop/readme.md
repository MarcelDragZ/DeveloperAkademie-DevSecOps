## Project Overview

This repository contains the solutions for the OWASP Juice Shop hacking challenges. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate various security vulnerabilities and exploitations using Juice Shop, a vulnerable web application created for educational purposes. Each challenge is documented with the necessary steps to reproduce the vulnerabilities, along with explanations of the security risks and mitigations.

## Challenges

### Challenge 1: Upload Type + Upload 100kb

**Location**: `3-Upload-Type+Upload-100kb/`  
**Description**: This challenge demonstrates how to bypass file upload restrictions by manipulating the file type. Additionally, it checks whether files larger than 100kb can be uploaded.

### Challenge 2: Expired Coupon

**Location**: `4-Expired-Coupon/`  
**Description**: This challenge shows how expired coupons can be reactivated to be used for purchases.

### Challenge 3: Change Bender's password + login bender

**Location**: `5-Change-Benders-password+login-bender/`  
**Description**: In this challenge, you will change Bender's password and log in to his account. This vulnerability occurs because insufficient security measures are implemented for the password change process.

### Challenge 4: Extra Language

**Location**: `5-Extra-Language/`  
**Description**: This challenge allows the addition of an extra language to the application by exploiting a vulnerability in the language support system.
